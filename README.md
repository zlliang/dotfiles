# Dotfiles ðŸŒš

Here are several dotfiles I am using on my macOS, and guides to configure a development environment.

## Configuration files

These files mirror the typical layout of configuration files in the `$HOME` directory. To copy them to their appropriate locations, run [`install.sh`](./install.sh)

## Guide to configure a new Mac

1. Install _Xcode Command Line Tools_: run `xcode-select --install`
2. Install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh)
3. Install [Git](https://git-scm.com) and [Git-LFS](https://git-lfs.github.com) (via Homebrew)
4. Set [Fish](https://fishshell.com) as the default shell:
   - Install via Homebrew: `brew install fish`
   - Add `/opt/homebrew/bin/fish` to `/etc/shells`
   - Set the default shell: `chsh -s /opt/homebrew/bin/fish`
   - _Note that_ the configuration file of fish is `~/.config/fish/config.fish`
5. Programming language toolkits:
   - JavaScript: [`nodenv`](https://github.com/nodenv/nodenv) for [Node.js](https://nodejs.org), and [`bun`](https://bun.sh) (`brew install oven-sh/bun/bun`)
   - Python: [`pyenv`](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv)
   - Go: [`go`](https://go.dev) (`brew install go`)
   <!-- - Rust: [`rustup`](https://rustup.rs/) -->
   - Zig: [`zig`](https://ziglang.org) (`brew install zig`)
6. Command line tools:

   - Good to have:
      - [`tokei`](https://github.com/XAMPPRocky/tokei): Code counter
      - [`dust`](https://github.com/bootandy/dust): A more intuitive version of `du`
      - [`btop`](https://github.com/aristocratos/btop): A terminal monitor of system resources
